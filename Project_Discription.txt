The aim of my project is to predict the likelihood of individuals receiving the XYZ flu vaccine and the seasonal flu vaccine. I carefully processed the data by addressing missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features to ensure accurate analysis. I utilized a RandomForestClassifier within a MultiOutputClassifier to predict the probabilities of vaccine uptake for both vaccines. The model's performance was assessed using the ROC AUC metric to ensure reliability. Finally, I compiled the predicted probabilities into a submission file, adhering to the competition guidelines, with the hope of contributing valuable insights to public health efforts.
